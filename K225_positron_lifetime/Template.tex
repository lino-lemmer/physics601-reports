\section{Slow circuit setup}

\subsection{LYSO spectrum}

We take the LYSO spectrum of the left and right detectors.

\subsection{Gain adjust using sodium}

In the sodium spectrum, we expect to see the \SI{511}{\kilo\electronvolt} line
from the annihilation as well as a \SI{1275}{\kilo\electronvolt} line from the
excited neon.

We adjust the gain of the amplifiers such that the sodium spectrum fill the
8192 channels of the MCA\@. The maximum window width of the SCA is not
sufficient to let everything through. Also the upper bound for the SCA is below
the last channel of the MCA\@. Therefore we cannot set the amplifier as high as
we would like to. For the spectrum, we adjust the lower bound such that the
window covers the two lines we are interested.

We check the coincidence of both SCA signals.

\section{Fast circuit setup}

Slow-signal and CFD signal, adjust CFD such that zero-line vanishes.

Look at CFD signals where stop-signal is delayed. We can verify that there is a
\SI{20}{\milli\second} delay between the two.

TAC produces an output.

\section{Time calibration}

SCA coincidence already checked.

TAC+coincidence has very nice overlap.

Use coincidence as MCA-gate and TAC as MCA input, we take prompt curves.
