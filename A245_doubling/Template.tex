\chapter{Theory}

\section{Generation of harmonics}

This section follows the work by
\textcite[Chapter~12]{meschede/optik_licht_laser/2008}.

A normal driven harmonic oscillator obeys the differential equation for the
force,
\[
    \ddot x + \omega_0^2 x = \frac qm \mathcal E \cos(\omega t) \,,
\]
where $x(t)$ is the position of the oscillating particle, $\omega_0^2$ the
eigenfrequency of the system, $q/m$ the specific electric charge, $\mathcal E$
the driving field amplitude and $\omega$ the external driving frequency. The
solutions of this equation are harmonics with frequency!$\omega$ and a certain
amplitude which depends on the distance of $\omega$ from $\omega_0$.

The linear force is a good approximation until ones uses high intensity laser
beams. Then one needs to include the next term in the force expansion, $\alpha
x^2$. For $\alpha \ll 1$ we can neglect $\alpha^2$ terms. The solution~$x(t)$
will then consist of two summands, the first is the already known harmonic with
$\omega$: $x^{(1)}(t) = x_\text l \cos(\omega t)$ with $x_\text l$ the
amplitude of the linear part. The second summand, suppressed by $\alpha$ will
approximately obey the differential equation
\[
    \ddot x^{(2)} + \omega_0^2 x^{(2)} \simeq - \alpha x_\mathrm l^2
    \cos(\omega t)^2 \,.
\]
Using the relation $\cos(\omega t)^2 = 1/2 + \cos(2 \omega t)/2$ we see that
there will be a constant part and a part oscillating with $2 \omega$. The
amplitude of that part has to be derived.

% TODO Weak conversion.

\section{Birefringence}

\subsection{Retarder plates}

\section{Phase matching}

This section follows the work by
\textcite[Section~12.4.3]{meschede/optik_licht_laser/2008}.

As one has seen in the section about the generation of harmonics, the phase
difference $\Deltaup k$ determines the strength of the second harmonic. The
best results are obtained for $\Deltaup k = 0$. With \emph{phase matching}, one
can tune $\Deltaup k \approx 0$. Since we have
\[
    \Deltaup k
    = k_{2\omega} - 2 k_\omega
    = \frac{2\omega}{c} (n_{2\omega} - n_\omega) \,,
\]
the phase difference depends on the difference in the refractive index~$n$ at
the given frequency
\parencite[Equation~(12.12)]{meschede/optik_licht_laser/2008}. The idea is to
give the fundamental and harmonic frequency the same refractive index such that
$\Deltaup k = 0$. By using birefringent materials one has a different
refractive index depending on the polarization and direction through the
crystal.

Crystals used for frequency conversion have a normal dispersion relation. This
means that the refractive index is lower for higher wavelength. In order to
match the refractive indices of $\omega$ (large wavelength) and $2\omega$
(small wavelength), one has to choose the larger refractive index for the
fundamental wave and the smaller one for the harmonic. Depending on the crystal
one might have $n_\mathrm o < n_\mathrm e$ (called \emph{positive}) or
$n_\mathrm o > n_\mathrm e$ (called \emph{negative}).

Using the phase difference one can define a \emph{coherence length}
$l_\text{coh} = \piup/\Deltaup k$ which gives the distance over which the
harmonic amplitude oscillates
\parencite[Equation~(12.14)]{meschede/optik_licht_laser/2008}. For typical
crystals without intervention one finds $l_\text{coh} \simeq
\SI{10}{\micro\meter}$
\parencite[Section~12.4.1]{meschede/optik_licht_laser/2008}. This means that we
definitely have to match the phases in order to get significant light output.


\subsection{Type 1 and 2}

We will only describe the case of negative uniaxial crystals here. For a
positive uniaxial crystal one just takes perpendicular polarizations. As we are
in a negative crystal we have $n_\mathrm o > n_\mathrm e$. As the fundamental
wave has to take the larger refractive index, which is the \emph{ordinary}
direction. The harmonic wave must be---at least partially---in the
extraordinary direction.

We have two choices to choose the incoming polarization. Choosing the
polarization of the fundamental wave to be purely ordinary we can only combine
two photons of the ordinary direction into one photon of the extraordinary
direction. This is called \emph{type 1 phase matching}. The other way is to
choose a \SI{45}{\degree} angle of the fundamental wave. It will have equal
parts which propagate in the ordinary and extraordinary direction. One photon
of each direction can then be combined into one harmonic photon. That way is
called \emph{type 2 phase matching}.

In a real crystal it would be an unlikely coincidence that the refractive
indices for ordinary and extraordinary transmission are exactly equal at
$\omega$ and $2\omega$. Therefore one needs one degree of freedom to adjust.

\subsection{Angle adjustment}

Every crystal can be tilted such that the angle between the optical axis of the
crystal and the incoming light is $\pi/2 + \theta$. A better way is to say that
the surface normal of the optical table forms an angle $\theta$ with the
optical axis of the crystal. By tilting the crystal one can can tune the
effect refractive index of the extraordinary direction. We then have
\[
    \frac1{n_\mathrm e(\theta)}
    = \frac{\cos(\theta^2)}{n_\mathrm o^2}
    + \frac{\sin(\theta^2)}{n_\mathrm e^2} \,,
\]
as given by \textcite[Equation!(3.31)]{meschede/optik_licht_laser/2008}. Given
the refractive indices one can then find the optimal angle for the crystal. One
problem with this method is the \emph{walk-off} as the harmonic light now has
the same phase velocity but not necessarily the same direction.

We do not use this method in our experiment as we have something fancier.

\subsection{90 degree adjustment}

The \emph{\SI{90}{\degree} adjustment} or \emph{temperature adjustment} does
not have the problem of walk-off. One uses $\theta = 0$ in order to have
perfectly perpendicular propagation directions. In order to fine-tune the
refractive indices one uses a temperature dependence. So instead of matching
via tilt one does via temperature dependence. The material used in our
experiment, $\mathrm{KNbO_3}$ has a sufficient temperature dependence to allow
phase matching for frequency doubling in the range
\SIrange{950}{1060}{\nano\meter} for a b-cut crystal. This \enquote b refers to
the cut direction. This crystal material has different refractive indices in
all three directions (\enquote a, \enquote b and \enquote c), therefore one can
choose the frequency range to work with.

\section{Diode laser}
\label{sec:diode_laser}

% TODO Describe elliptical beam shape.

\chapter{Conduction and analysis}

\section{Diode laser classification}

First we want to classify the Laser diode at hand. We have a diode laser which
is mounted behind a safety shutter. One of the characteristics of a diode laser
is the elliptical beam shape as described in Section~\ref{sec:diode_laser}
already. Therefore our setup includes a pair of prisms in order to get a
circular beam cross section. The whole setup including the power meter is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:fig-1}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig-1}
    \caption{%
        Setup for characterizing the diode laser. Taken from the manual.
    }
    \label{fig:fig-1}
\end{figure}

For measuring the power we just dump the whole beam into a power meter. Since
the power meter become non-linear beyond \SI{20}{\milli\watt} we use an
attenuator in front of it. This will take away a certain fraction of the beam
and allow us to measure higher intensities. The attenuator has to be calibrated
first with small beam powers to allow for a comparison.

% TODO Measure up to 280 mA.
% TODO Measure background.
% TODO Calibrate attenuator.

\subsection{Injection current}

% TODO Plot output versus current.

\subsection{Threshold current}

% TODO Extract threshold.

\subsection{Quantum efficiency}

% TODO Compute differential slope efficiency.
% TODO Compute quantum efficiency from slope.

\subsection{Variable attenuator}
\label{sec:variable_attenuator}

The laser might experience \emph{mode hops} when we adjust the current.
Therefore we do not want to adjust laser power by the current during our
adjustment. We rather want to have an optical way to adjust the beam power. For
this we will use a polarizing beam splitter and a $\lambda/2$-plate in front of
that. By adjusting the polarization of the beam going into the polarizing
splitter we can select the portion of the power advancing to the next parts in
our setup. We extend out setup with a plate and splitter like shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:fig-2}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig-2}
    \caption{%
        %
    }
    \label{fig:fig-2}
\end{figure}

We must obtain a relation of retarder plate angle and output power to use this
later on. There is only one power meter and we want to measure the powers of
both the fundamental and harmonic beam at the same time. We take power
measurements of the fundamental beam in \SI{2.5}{\degree} steps of the retarder
plate.

% TODO Measure power depending on the retarder plate angle.

We expect to see a $\cos^2$ profile, perhaps with a constant offset.

% TODO Fit data.

\subsubsection{Extinction ratio}

% TODO Determine extinction ratio.

\section{Harmonic power}

Now we have the power measurement calibrated. We can determine the power in the
fundamental beam from the angle of the retarder plate. Our setup is extended
with the non-linear crystal and a filter as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fig-4}.
The blue filter is needed to get rid of the fundamental wave, we only want to
measure the power of the harmonic wave here.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{fig-4}
    \caption{%
        %
    }
    \label{fig:fig-4}
\end{figure}

The crystal used here is a $\mathrm{KNbO_3}$ crystal. It has a cross section of
\SI{2}{\milli\meter} times \SI{1.8}{\milli\meter}. It is cut along the b-axis
and has a length of \SI{5}{\milli\meter}. The end faces are coating to avoid
reflections at \SI{987}{\nano\meter} and \SI{494}{\nano\meter}.
\parencite[6]{lab_course/doubling/manual}

% TODO Write about adjustment.

\subsection{Output power optimization}

With the rough optical setup in place we can insert the crystal and optimize
for maximum harmonic power. We slowly heat up the crystal to \SI{36}{\celsius}.
Then we slide it into the focus of our setup.

% TODO Check with paper behind the crystal that one can see something.

The blue harmonic light is focused with an achromatic lens and filtered with an
\SI{3}{\milli\meter} BG40 glass filter. From Figure~3 of the manual we estimate
a total transmission coefficient of \num{0.9} at \SI{494}{\nano\meter}. For the
unwanted fundamental wave we have a transmission coefficient of around
$10^{-2.3} = 0.005$.

% TODO Think about the effect of the fundamental wave in our measurement here.

We slightly move the crystal to optimize the output power.

% TODO Compute beam waist.
% TODO Compute Rayleigh length.
% TODO Determine the fulfillment of the Boyd-Kleinman condition.
% TODO Determine optimal focal length.

\subsection{Crystal temperature dependence}

Since the index of refraction is temperature depending in our crystal material
we want to measure the temperature dependence. First we cool down to
\SI{27}{\degree} in steps of \SI{0.5}{\celsius} and then heat up to
\SI{40}{\celsius} in steps of \SI{0.2}{\celsius}.

% TODO Take measurements of power and background at each temperature.

% TODO Plot data such that sinc shape can be seen.
% TODO Try to fit a sinc function.
% TODO Explain why the curve could be asymmetric.

Now that we know the optimal temperature for the crystal, we slowly tune the
temperature to this optimal setting.

\subsection{Input power dependence}

The output power must depend on the input power. As we have calibrated in
Section~\ref{sec:variable_attenuator}, we can choose an input power by rotating
the retarder plate in front of the splitter. We measure the output power while
adjusting the angle of the retarder plate.

% TODO Table with measurements.

% TODO Plot output power versus input power.
% TODO Determine expected relationship.
% TODO Fit model to data.
% TODO Extract frequency doubling efficiency.

\subsection{Input polarization dependence}

By taking out the polarizing beam splitter we can freely adjust the linear
polarization of the light that goes into the crystal. We take a set of
measurements of the output power with different angles of the retarder plate.

% TODO Table with measurements.

% TODO Plot.
% TODO What do we expect for type 1 and type 2?
% TODO Fit the data.
% TODO Are the fit parameters sensible?

\section{Wavelength comparison}

As this experiment is titled \emph{frequency doubling} we except that the
frequency of the incident beam has doubled pretty much exactly. In the
following parts we will compare the two wavelengths with each other and
determine how exact the doubling actually is.

\subsection{Grating}

The first and quick method is using a grating to have a wavelength dependent
diffraction. As the diffraction angle scales with diffraction order $n$ and
wavelength $\lambda$ as a quotient we would expect to see an overlap of the
$n$-th order fundamental wave and the $2n$-th order harmonic wave.

% TODO Increase resolution by using achromatic lens with largest focal length.

% TODO Show all used lengths in a drawing.
% TODO How accurately is the measurement?
% TODO Compare to theoretical resolution.

\subsection{Michelson interferometer}

The rough confirmation of the frequency doubling can be made more precise with
a Michelson interferometer. The setup which we are going to build now is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:fig-5}.

% TODO Describe how we set this thing up.
