\section{Absorption and resonances}

Like the electrons in an atom, the constituents of a nucleus also have
excited states and associated energy levels. As the nucleus is orders of
magnitude smaller than the whole atom, the relevant energies are orders of
magnitude larger. The hydrogen transition energies are in the order of
\SIrange{1}{10}{\electronvolt} whereas the transition energies cobalt and iron
are in the order of \SIrange{10}{100}{\kilo\electronvolt}.

If the energy matches an allowed transition, a nucleus can also absorb
electromagnetic radiation and transition into an excited state. As most nuclei
in a metal are in the groundstate, the highest absorption can be obtained by a
transition from the groundstate. Photons with the required energy are created
by an excited nucleus of the same isotope decaying into the groundstate.

The experimental setup here will have a radiation source made from cobalt. This
decays into excited iron via electron capture (EC), see Figure~\ref{fig:ec}.
The excited nucleus in turn will decay into the groundstate via some
metastable states. See Figure~\ref{fig:co57} for the decay scheme of the
radioactive material used in this experiment. The transition into the
groundstate is the one from $3/2^-$ to $1/2^-$ with an energy gap of $\hbar
\omega = \SI{14.4}{\kilo\electronvolt}$.

The emission lines are not perfectly sharp. This limits the chance of
absorption by the same kind of nucleus. The broadening effects are the
following:

\begin{description}
    \item[Natural width]
        The lifetime $\tau$ of every metastable state is limited. If it were
        not, one would not observe the transition. Together with the
        energy-time-uncertainty this directly leads to a line width of
        \[
            \Gamma = \frac\hbar\tau \,.
        \]
        Our line of interest, the \SI{14.4}{\kilo\electronvolt}-line has a
        lifetime of \SI{141}{\nano\second} and therefore a width of $\Gamma =
        \SI{4.7e-9}{\electronvolt}$. Compared to energy of the photons
        themselves, this is a relative width of \num{3.3e-13} which is very
        small compared to the other effects.
        \parencite[42]{Schatz/Nukleare_Festkoerperphysik}

    \item[Doppler effect]
        A relative motion between source and target will lead to a Doppler
        shift. The Lorentz transformation connecting the two systems boosts the
        photon's energy. If the source particles are subject to thermal
        motions, the spectrum will be broadened. At room temperature the shifts
        in energy are around \SI{10e-2}{\electronvolt}
        \parencite[43]{Schatz/Nukleare_Festkoerperphysik}, depending on the
        angle of motion and emission.

        The natural line width could be ignored when the Doppler effect is
        present.

    \item[Recoil]
        The photon carries momentum $\hbar k$. In the center of mass frame of
        the emitting nucleus, the nucleus will take the recoil $- \hbar k$. The
        energy of the nucleus then is
        \[
            \frac{[\hbar k]^2}{2 M} \,
        \]
        where $M$ is the mass of nucleus. This energy is subtracted from the
        photon; the photon has a reduced frequency when emitted from a free
        nucleus.
\end{description}

Taking all those effects together, it becomes unlikely that the photons emitted
by a gas of decaying cobalt will be absorbed by a gas of iron, ignoring that it
might be impractical to realize this situation. The issue of the recoil can be
reduced by embedding the nuclei of interest into a solid. The lattice will
absorb the excess momentum and due to its practically infinite mass (\num{e23}
larger), there will be no recoil velocity and therefore no energy shift in the
photon.

\section{Hyperfine structure}

The angular momentum $l$ and the spin $s$ of the nucleus couple to a combined
spin $j$. The component along the quantization axis, $m_j$, takes values
between $-j$ and $j$. The various states organize themselves into the
irreducible representations of $\SU(2)$, the multiplets with spin $j$ and
$(2j+1)$ states each. The different multiplets have different energies, the
energies within the same multiplet are degenerate, see left part of
Figure~\ref{fig:M1}. Breaking the $\SU(2)$ symmetry of the spins give the
nuclear analogue of the Zeeman effect. This is done with an external magnetic
field by the interaction term $- \vec\mu \cdot \vec B$. The degeneracy is
broken and each multiplet is split up into equidistant levels, see the right
part of said figure.

The magnetic moment $\vec \mu$ is coupled to the spin via the nuclear magneton
$\mu_\text N$ or the gyromagnetic ratio $\gamma$,
\[
    \mu = \underbrace{g \frac{\mu_\text N}{\hbar}}_{\gamma} \hbar j \,.
\]
Choosing the quantization axis along the external magnetic field $\vec B$ will
simplify the interaction $- \vec \mu \cdot \vec B$ to $- g \mu_\text N m_j$.
The $m_j$ are (half-)integers and therefore equidistant. This makes the energy
levels equidistant within a multiplet.

    }
    \label{fig:M1}
\end{figure}

Both source and target are embedded into a solid, therefore there is
little thermal fluctuation and also very little recoil. This means that the
lines are rather sharp. Only the target is embedded into a magnetic field. The
source iron nuclei do not have the Zeeman splitting and therefore always emit a
pretty exact \SI{14.4}{\kilo\electronvolt} line. In order for the target in the
magnetic field to absorb this line, the energy needs to be adjusted.

By moving the source with a motor, one can leverage the Doppler shift to alter
the energy of the photon. As this velocity is controlled, one can effectively
measure the energy shifts and therefore the hyperfine structure in the iron
target. We are interested in the deviation from $\hbar \omega_0 =
\SI{14.4}{\kilo\electronvolt}$ and want to extract the magnetic moment of the
groundstate and the exited state.

The needed relation between Doppler velocity $v$ and the magnetic moments
$\mu$, $\mu'$ is
\[
    v = - \frac{c}{\hbar \omega_0}
    \sbr{\frac{\mu'}{j'} m_j' - \frac{\mu}{j} m_j}
    \,,
\]
where the primed quantities are the exited state
\parencite[(4.42)]{Schatz/Nukleare_Festkoerperphysik}. Expressing the magnetic
moments in terms of the nuclear magneton, we see the relation between the Landé
factors more clearly:
\[
    v = - \frac{c \mu_\text N}{\hbar \omega_0} \sbr{g' m_j' - g m_j}
    \,.
\]

The selection rule for magnetic dipole radiation (M1) is $m_j - m_j' \in \{ -1,
0, 1 \}$. Therefore we expect to see six velocities with high absorption.
